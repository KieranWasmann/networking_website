		<h2>Home</h2>
		<h3>Creating a home network may seem a daunting task, however it
		 is not as hard as you think.</h3>
		<p> To create a network you will need
		 several things, to start you should ensure you have an
		 internet connection, provided by your internet service provider
		 (ISP). When you set up your internet connection your ISP should
		 send a "router". This is actualy a modem, router, switch and hub
		  and wireless access point all in one. If your ISP doesnot supply you with one, you will
		 have to buy one yourself.
		Once you have this you should be able to follow instructions on the box to set it up. After that you should be able to connect all devices, both wirelessly and physically.</P>
		<p> A physical connection should be done with a cat 6 cable with RJ45 ends. This can connect printers, network attached storage, desktop computers and most other devices that are not moved around a lot. Other devices that must be moved reguarly should be connected wirelessly, simply by joining the wifi network. Most wireless access points use 802.11n porotocol, which is backwards compatable with most devices that may use 802.11g or earlier.</P>
