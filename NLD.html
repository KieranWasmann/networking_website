	<h2>What are these components?</h2>
	<h4>Modem</h4>
	<p>The modem is what allows the communication between devices and the external line. This is required because data is transferred over telephone lines in analog waves, while it is stored, read and processed on computers and devices digitally.</p>
	<h4>Router</h4>
	<p> The router carries out traffic direcing, which is the passing and receiving of packets of data over the internet between other routers.</p>
	<h4>Switch</h4>
	<p>The switch allows communication between devices within a network. It recieves packets then forwards them to the relevant devices.</p>
	<h4>Wireless Access Point (WAP)</h4>
	<p>The wireless acces point is what connects devices without a physical connection to your network. It creates your wifi, however it on its own does not have an internet connection</p>
	<h4>Desktop PC<h4>

	<h4>Network Attached Storage (NAS)</h4>
	<p>Network attached storage allows the access and use of storage by all devices connected in a network.</p>
	<h4>Printer<h4>
